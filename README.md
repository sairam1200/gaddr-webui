## Features

**Stalwart WebUI** is schema-driven single-page application for administering [Stalwart](https://stalw.art). After authentication the panel fetches a JSON schema from the server and dynamically generates all forms, lists, navigation, and layouts from that schema. Nothing is hardcoded.

Key features:

- **Schema-driven UI**: All forms, lists, and navigation are generated from a JSON schema fetched from `/api/schema` after login. No object types, field names, or layouts are hardcoded.
- **JMAP protocol**: All data operations (queries, creates, updates, deletes, blob uploads) use JMAP (RFC 8620) with method chaining and result references.
- **Permission-aware**: Every button, link, field, and section respects the user's permissions. Elements the user cannot access are hidden.

## Get Started

Stalwart WebUI is included with Stalwart Mail Server, to install Stalwart Mail Server on your server by following the instructions for your platform:

- [Linux / MacOS](https://stalw.art/docs/install/linux)
- [Windows](https://stalw.art/docs/install/windows)
- [Docker](https://stalw.art/docs/install/docker)

All documentation is available at [stalw.art/docs/get-started](https://stalw.art/docs/get-started).

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 18 or later
- A running Stalwart instance (for JMAP API calls)

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Configuration is done through Vite environment variables. Copy or edit `.env.development` in the project root:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:443
VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=
VITE_OAUTH_SCOPES=
```

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | URL of the Stalwart server. Used for all API requests during development. In production builds (when empty or unset) requests are relative to the current origin. |
| `VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` | When set, skips the OAuth flow entirely and uses this token for all requests. Useful for local development and testing. |
| `VITE_OAUTH_SCOPES` | Optional OAuth scopes. Omitted from the authorization request when empty. |

### OAuth client ID

The OAuth 2.0 client ID is not a build-time setting. It is read at runtime from a meta tag in `index.html`:

```html
<meta name="oauth-client-id" content="" />
```

The server rewrites the `content` attribute when it serves the page, so a single build works for any deployment. When no
client ID is configured the attribute is left empty and the panel falls back to `stalwart-webui`.

### Bypassing OAuth for development

Set `VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` to a valid bearer token to skip the login page and go straight to the admin panel. You can obtain a token from the Stalwart server's token endpoint or use an API key:

```
VITE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-bearer-token-here
```

### Running the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite's development server with hot module replacement, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

Run the unit tests (Vitest):

```
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```

## Building for production

```
npm run build
```

This runs the TypeScript compiler followed by Vite's production build. Output
goes to the `dist/` directory.

To preview the production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```
